    abstract="In this paper we analyze completeness results for basic narrowing. We show that basic narrowing is not complete with respect to normalizable solutions for equational theories defined by confluent term rewriting systems, contrary to what has been conjectured. By imposing syntactic restrictions on the rewrite rules we recover completeness. We refute a result of H{\"o}lldobler which states the completeness of basic conditional narrowing for complete (i.e. confluent and terminating) conditional term rewriting systems without extra variables in the conditions of the rewrite rules. In the last part of the paper we extend the completeness results of Giovannetti and Moiso for level-confluent and terminating conditional systems with extra variables in the conditions to systems that may also have extra variables in the right-hand sides of the rules.",

    abstract = "Functional and logic programming are the most important declarative programming paradigms, and interest in combining them has grown over the last decade. Early research concentrated on the definition and improvement of execution principles for such integrated languages, while more recently efficient implementations of these execution principles have been developed so that these languages became relevant for practical applications. In this paper, we survey the development of the operational semantics as well as the improvement of the implementation of functional logic languages."

    abstract="Fay has described in [2,3] a complete T-unification for equational theories T which possess a complete set of reductions as defined by Knuth-Bendix [12]. This algorithm relies essentially on using the narrowing process defined by Lankford [13]. In this paper, we first study the relations between narrowing and unification and we give a new version of Fay's algorithm. We then show how to eliminate many redundancies in this algorithm and give a sufficient condition for the termination of the algorithm. In a last part, we show how to extend the previous results to various kinds of canonical term rewriting systems.",

	abstract="Term rewriting systems are important for computability theory of abstract data types, for automatic theorem proving, and for the foundations of functional programming. In this short survey we present, starting from first principles, several of the basic notions and facts in the area of term rewriting. Our treatment, which often will be informal, covers abstract rewriting, Combinatory Logic, orthogonal systems, strategies, critical pair completion, and some extended rewriting formats.",

First we prove the completeness of unification based on original narrowing under a weaker condition than the previous proof. Then we discuss the relation between basic narrowing and innermost reduction as the lifting lemma, and prove the completeness of unification based on basic narrowing. Moreover, we give the switching lemma to combine the previous algorithm and our new proof.",

    abstract="Fay has described in [2,3] a complete T-unification for equational theories T which possess a complete set of reductions as defined by Knuth-Bendix [12]. This algorithm relies essentially on using the narrowing process defined by Lankford [13]. In this paper, we first study the relations between narrowing and unification and we give a new version of Fay's algorithm. We then show how to eliminate many redundancies in this algorithm and give a sufficient condition for the termination of the algorithm. In a last part, we show how to extend the previous results to various kinds of canonical term rewriting systems.",

	abstract="Term rewriting systems are important for computability theory of abstract data types, for automatic theorem proving, and for the foundations of functional programming. In this short survey we present, starting from first principles, several of the basic notions and facts in the area of term rewriting. Our treatment, which often will be informal, covers abstract rewriting, Combinatory Logic, orthogonal systems, strategies, critical pair completion, and some extended rewriting formats.",

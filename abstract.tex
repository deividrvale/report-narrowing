    In this report we study some completeness results about narrowing and narrowing derivations. The study is based on the paper by the authors Aart Middeldorp and Erik Hamoen, ``Completeness results on basic narrowing'' \cite{Middeldorp1994}. In their work the authors give various results on the completeness problem for various kinds of narrowing derivations strategy and we study and discuss about these results. Finally, we give an example of application of narrowing techniques to the fusion of functional and logic programming language, this is based on the survey paper: ``The Integration of Functions into Logic Programming: From Theory to Practice'' by Michael Hanus, \cite{HANUS1994583}. We have developed some examples (compuational most of the times) with the objective of made the presentation clearer. The proofs in this report is given by the authors, we have at least extend them to be more concise in the presentation.
